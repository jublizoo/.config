# .config
This file contains my dotfiles and other configuration files for software related to my development workflow.
This repository is currently incomplete.

## Nvim
My Neovim configuration, not using any package/LSP managers.
I use Neotree for a visual file structure overview, Telescope for fuzzy searching, and Oil for creating, deleting, and renaming files.
I use blink.cmp for completion and automatic function signatures.
I use many additional shortcuts, such as displaying function signatures, modifying the f, F, t, T keys to work across lines, and navigating windows.
